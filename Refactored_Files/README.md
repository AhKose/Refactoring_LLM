# LLM-Driven Refactored Microservice Files
This directory exclusively contains the specific microservice files that were identified and refactored by Large Language Models (LLMs). Please note that these folders do not contain the complete original microservice architectures; they only host the files that were modified during the LLM-driven refactoring process.

You can navigate through the subfolders in this directory to find the updated source code for each of files, organized according to their corresponding service and trial.
