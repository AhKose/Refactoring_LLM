# LLM-Driven Refactored Microservice Files
This directory exclusively contains the specific microservice files that were identified and refactored by Large Language Models (LLMs). Please note that these folders do not contain the complete original microservice architectures; they only host the files that were modified during the LLM-driven refactoring process.

The summary table below illustrates the specific files targeted for refactoring by three different models (Claude, GPT, and Gemini) across two independent trials, categorized by their respective services (Image, Persistence, Recommender, and Reactive_Calender).

## Selection Legend:
To highlight the consensus and variance among the different LLMs, the targeted files are color-coded as follows:

* **Blue:** Files selected for refactoring by all 3 LLMs (Strong Consensus).

* **Orange/Yellow:** Files selected by exactly 2 LLMs (Partial Consensus).

* **Red:** Files selected by only 1 LLM (Unique Identification).

You can navigate through the subfolders in this directory to find the updated source code for each of the listed files, organized according to their corresponding service and trial.
